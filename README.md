## Projects

### 99 bottles
[source](https://github.com/jorgegonzalez/beginner-projects/blob/master/README.md#99-bottles)
- Create a program that prints out every line to the song "99 bottles of beer on the wall."
- Do not use a list for all of the numbers, and do not manually type them all in. Use a built in function instead.
- Besides the phrase "take one down," you may not type in any numbers/names of numbers directly into your song lyrics.
- Remember, when you reach 1 bottle left, the word "bottles" becomes singular.

### Magic 8 Ball
[source](https://github.com/jorgegonzalez/beginner-projects/blob/master/README.md#magic-8-ball)
- Simulate a magic 8-ball.
- Allow the user to enter their question.
- Display an in progress message(i.e. "thinking").
- Create 20 responses, and show a random response.
- Allow the user to ask another question or quit.
- Bonus:
  - Add a gui.
  - It must have box for users to enter the question.
  - It must have at least 4 buttons:
    - ask
    - clear (the text box)
    - play again
    - quit (this must close the window)
